lead_text: "A photo album of reimagined memories."
artist_statement: "This artwork is a photo album of reimagined memories, utilizing the Apple Photos interface. Each row of images contains alterations of different pictures, with changes to layers, backgrounds, and textures. My practice involved the remixing of different images, associating them with both aesthetic and conceptual themes. The photo album was recreated in GIMP to be nostalgic, referencing previous works in the Media Art and Design Practice course, and older images from my camera roll. It accounts for how artwork is not static and can grant new perspectives later on."
