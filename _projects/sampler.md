lead_text: "A web-based live audio sampler used as part of a group music composition."
artist_statement: "This web-based audio sampler lets users import pre-recorded or live audio and modify it by adding choruses or adjusting the playback rate, volume, and sound quality. This tool was used as an instrument in a four person laptop band, complimenting other MIDI-modulated devices. This was programmed using the Tone.JS library for JavaScript. My practice was inspired by the remixing and overlaying of sounds from earlier lectures of the Algorithmic Music Online course. This project encapsulates creative coding with some technical programming."
