lead_text: "A task manager Google Calendar extension for college students with ADHD."
artist_statement: "This tool was designed as a focus and task planning app for students with ADHD as a part of an inclusive technology course. My involvement in the project included backend programming for the web application, where calendar tasks would be synchronized between Google Calendar and the app. Our group went for a minimalist and intuitive design that encourages users to complete their designated task. The app is made to be flexible and adaptable to the userâ€™s schedule, and the user can prioritize their most productive work times."
