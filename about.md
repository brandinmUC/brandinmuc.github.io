**Brandin Moore** is a programmer and photographer from Brooklyn, New York, that enjoys combining tech with creativity. Coming from an urban environment, Brandin enjoys visually capturing the stories of different environments, scenarios, and communities. As a programmer, he enjoys creative coding and creating accessible and secure technologies. As a part of a group course project in February 2025, he designed the backend for [FocusBloom](https://github.com/bensim0305/FocusBloom), a task scheduling application intended for students with ADHD. He also created a [digital sampler](https://brandinmuc.github.io/Sampler-for-Algorithmic-Music-Composition/), which was used in a group musical composition.

In his photography, he has worked with multiple organizations in capturing the visions of creative and professional storytelling. In May 2024, he worked with the University of Chicago’s Major Activities Board to photograph concert photos for their premier concert, Summer Breeze. These photos were later published in [Firebird Magazine’s 2025 issue](https://firebirdmagazine.com/mag/firebird-magazine-issue-2), the University’s only music publication. He has also worked with the [Visuals Series at UChicago](https://www.instagram.com/visualsuchi/), bringing the stories of Black creatives to life. 

At his core, Brandin is passionate about community, storytelling, and exploration. He graduates from the University of Chicago with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in June 2025, and completion of the Media Arts and Design minor program.
